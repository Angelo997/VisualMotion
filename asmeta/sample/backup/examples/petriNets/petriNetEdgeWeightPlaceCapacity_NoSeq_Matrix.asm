//petri net with edge weight, place capacity and
//avoiding the use of seq in the firing of the transition.

//the edges are described with two matrices (two boolean functions)

//About the transition rule in Petri nets with place capacity ("strict transition rule")
//From "Petri Nets: Properties, Analysis and Applications" by Tadao Murata:  
//For the above rule of transition enabling, it is assumed that each place can
//accommodate an unlimited number of tokens. Such a Petri net is referred to as
//an "infinite capacity net". For modeling many physical systems, it is natural to
//consider an upper limit to the number of tokens that each place can hold. Such
//a Petri net is referred to as a "finite capacity net". For a finite capacity
//net (N, M0), each place "p" has an associated capacity "K(p)", the maximum number of
//tokens that "p" can hold at any time. For finite capacity nets, for a transition
//"t" to be enabled, there is an additional condition that the number of tokens in
//each output place "p" of "t" cannot exceed its capacity "K(p)" after firing t.
