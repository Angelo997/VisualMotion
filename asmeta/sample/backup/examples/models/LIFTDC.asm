//Lift Control (N.Davis, 1984; see J-R Abrial: B-Book, 1996) 
//Design the logic to move n lifts bw m floors, and prove it to be well functioning.
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Each lift has for each floor one button which, if pressed, causes the lift to visit (i.e. move to and stop at) that floor.
//Each floor (except ground and top) has two buttons to request an up-lift and a down-lift. 
//They are cancelled when a lift visits the floor and is either travelling in the desired direction, or visits the floor
//with no requests outstanding. In the latter case, if both floor request buttons are illuminated, only one should be //cancelled.
//A lift without requests should remain in its final destination and await further requests.
//Each lift has an emergency button which, if pressed, causes a warning to be sent to the site manager. The lift is then //deemed �out of service�. Each lift has a mechanism to cancel its �out of service� status.
